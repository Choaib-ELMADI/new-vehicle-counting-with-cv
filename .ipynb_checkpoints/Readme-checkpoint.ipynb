    "## 2.1. Counting Approach Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important argument to configure is `counting_approach`, which determines the method used to count vehicles in the road traffic video scene. This framework offers four counting approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **detection_only**\n",
    "2. **tracking_without_line**\n",
    "3. **tracking_with_line**\n",
    "4. **tracking_with_two_lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1. detection_only\n",
    "This approach uses only a detector without a tracker. Each vehicle that crosses a predefined line - which can be set easily by specifying two points using the arguments `args.line_point11` and `args.line_point12` with percentages as described in the documentation above - is counted as a new vehicle. A vehicle is considered to have crossed the line if the distance between the line and the center point of the detected bounding box is less than the threshold `line_vicinity`, which can be manually set via the argument `args.line_vicinity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- More efficient as it doesn't use a tracker, reducing processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Vehicles may be over-counted if they appear in multiple consecutive frames.\n",
    "- This approach does not support the speed estimation algorithm.\n",
    "- Setting the reference line is not generic and depends on the specific traffic flow. You will need to adjust the line placement for each traffic scene based on the road traffic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the inaccuracy of this approach, you can reduce the `line_vicinity` threshold to nearly zero. However, a very small threshold may result in under-counting as some vehicles might not be counted. Alternatively, you can adjust the `vid_stride` argument to 2, 3, or 4, depending on the frame rate of your video. Generally:\n",
    "  - Increasing `line_vicinity` leads to more over-counting.\n",
    "  - Decreasing `line_vicinity` leads to more under-counting.\n",
    "  - Higher `vid_stride` values (e.g., 2, 3, 4) result in more information loss, causing high-speed vehicles to be under-counted and low-speed vehicles to be over-counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2. tracking_without_line\n",
    "This approach uses both a detector and a tracker to count vehicles, without relying on any reference lines. Instead, it is based on the unique IDs assigned by the tracker to each vehicle. The vehicle count in this approach corresponds to the number of unique IDs generated by the tracking algorithm. The accuracy of the count depends on the performance of the tracker in consistently assigning unique IDs across different frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "While high-performing trackers generally yield accurate results, even minor inaccuracies can lead to ID switches in complex scenes with overlapping, congestion, or fast-moving objects, resulting in significant counting errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these issues:\n",
    "- Increase the `vid_stride` argument to 2, 3, 4, or even 5, depending on your video scene.\n",
    "- Consider using more advanced trackers via the `tracking_method` argument.\n",
    "- Set `use_mask` to True and focus on specific areas of the video where counting is more reliable by defining the spatial box coordinates (of your focus) using the `included_box` argument to focus detection and tracking as described in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- More accurate than the \"detection_only\" approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Susceptible to ID switch issues in complex scenes, leading to over-counting.\n",
    "- Speed estimation is not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3. tracking_with_line\n",
    "This approach combines elements from both the `detection_only` and `tracking_without_line` methods. It utilizes a detector, a tracker, and a reference line to count vehicles. This method aims to mitigate the shortcomings of the `detection_only` approach (such as over-counting and under-counting) and the `tracking_without_line` approach (such as ID switch issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `tracking_with_line` approach, counting is performed only when vehicles cross a predefined line. By setting a larger `line_vicinity`, under-counting can be avoided. Tracking within the vicinity of the line helps to prevent over-counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Very accurate, performing well even in complex road traffic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Setting the reference line is not generic and depends on the specific traffic flow. For each different traffic scene, you will need to adjust the line placement based on the road traffic flow.\n",
    "- Speed estimation is not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Set Up:**\n",
    "- Define the reference line using `args.line_point11` and `args.line_point12`.\n",
    "- Adjust the `line_vicinity` to ensure accurate counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach effectively mitigates the issues of over-counting and under-counting seen in the `detection_only` method and the ID switch phenomena observed in the `tracking_without_line` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.4. tracking_with_two_lines\n",
    "This approach extends the `tracking_with_line` method. Instead of tracking vehicles in the vicinity of a single line, it tracks vehicles between two predefined lines. You can set these lines using the arguments `line_point11`, `line_point12`, `line_point21`, and `line_point22`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Includes all the advantages of the `tracking_with_line` approach.\n",
    "- Supports the speed estimation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Setting the reference lines is not generic and depends on the specific traffic flow. For each different traffic scene, you will need to adjust the line placements based on the road traffic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Set Up:**\n",
    "- Define the two reference lines using `args.line_point11`, `args.line_point12`, `args.line_point21`, and `args.line_point22`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines the strengths of the `tracking_with_line` method while enabling speed estimation, making it suitable for complex road traffic environments.\n"
